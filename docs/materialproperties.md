# Materials Properties
Demonstrate the calculation of common material properties with the `atomistics` package. The examples use different 
simulation codes, still the examples are not simulation code specific. It is one of the core features of the `atomistics`
package that all simulation workflow to calculate a specific material property can be executed with all simulation codes.
